# SVG/PNG Icons

Most SVG icons are loacated in `resourses/assets/svg` and build with SVG srpite
technique. However, some JavaScript libraries only accept loading image form URL.
In that case, separated SVG are still needed.

Favicon only support PNG, not SVG, for the moment. These PNG files are here, too.
